👋 Hey! I'm Garrett, and this is where I cultivate my thoughts across radically different domains. You'll find personal emotional reflections sitting next to chemical engineering concepts, therapy insights alongside in depth video game tutorials. That's kinda the point, our brains don't grow in *silos*, so let's grow a **garden**.

Long-form thoughts on life, learning, and everything in between. From self-reflection and therapy insights, to reaction kinetics, neuroscience, video games or philosophy, there's a lot. I try to be an enjoyer  : ) and I ponder a lot 😅

## 💭 Glog Philosophy

This isn't a blog with a niche. It's a workspace made public. 

You're seeing:

- **My actual notes** - not polished articles written for SEO
- **Work in progress** - ideas and pages that are still developing
- **Honest messiness** - the real process of learning and thinking

If you find something useful, great! If you see connections I haven't, even better. That's what gardens are for.
