# 🌿 The Glog™

👋 Hey! I'm Garrett, and this is where I cultivate my thoughts across radically different domains. You'll find personal emotional reflections sitting next to chemical engineering concepts, therapy insights alongside in depth video game tutorials. That's kinda the point, our brains don't grow in *silos*, so let's grow a **garden**.

## 💭 Glog Philosophy

This isn't a blog with a niche. It's a workspace made public. 

You're seeing:

- **My actual notes** - not polished articles written for SEO
- **Work in progress** - ideas and pages that are still developing
- **Honest messiness** - the real process of learning and thinking

If you find something useful, great! If you see connections I haven't, even better. That's what gardens are for.
