Recently, I watched a Dr. K video on ADHD, and one idea hit me like a truck: a lot of the pain of ADHD doesn't just come from the part of our brains that *doesn't* work well. A massive part of ADHD struggles comes from us **not using** a part of our brain that *does* work well.

In other words, it's not *only* "my brain is broken," it's also "I've been **leaning** on the wrong system." That realization explains a great deal about how I've been running my life.

## The Model: ADHD, The Frontal Lobe, and Habits

Here's a brief overview of the working model Dr. K talks about:

> [!Warning] Disclaimer
> This isn't the full neuroscience story, but as a working model for how ADHD feels from the inside, it fits scarily well.

- ADHD hits the **frontal lobe**, the part of the brain that handles focus, impulse control, planning, and sustained attention.
- There's another system in our brain, the habit system, that runs on different brain circuits with different neurotransmitters.
- Habits are automatic behaviors. They don't need much conscious focus or willpower once they're wired in. They just fire.

Growing up with ADHD, we tend to run into the same wall over and over:
- We may *know* what we're supposed to do.
- We may *try* to get organized, stay on top of things, and be responsible.
- And yet, usually we still drop the ball, miss deadlines, forget the important stuff, and watch everything we care about slowly slide out of our hands.

This consistent loop of trying ­→ failing → trying → failing, teaches our brain something awful: *no matter how hard I try, I screw it up anyway.*

At that point, we're not just dealing with ADHD; we're dealing with the **fear of failure** stacked on top of ADHD. We're so worried about failing that we *burn* what little focus we have on the possibility of failure instead of *using* it on the thing we're trying not to mess up. We become our own self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Damage Control vs. Damage Prevention

Here's the cursed superpower ADHD brings to the table: we are often really good at damage control and really bad at damage prevention.

When everything is on fire, when there are 17 deadlines in 24 hours and 14 things that have gone catastrophically wrong, the ADHD brain can suddenly lock in. All those years of last-minute scrambling, barely pulling things together, and **still surviving** that chaos due to last-minute 'lock-ins' taught our brains something dangerous:

> "If I'm going to screw up anyway, I might as well screw it up now, and create the chaos I'm good at surviving."

The brain learns that chaos is familiar. Chaos is where we've proven we can show up and perform. Prevention feels way more labor-intensive for our brains than cleanup, so we quietly start tolerating, and sometimes inviting, the mess.

I've never sat myself down and said, "Alright, Garrett, it's totally fine if you wreck this, because your brain is weird and you'll just heroically fix it later." But in practice? I've lived that philosophy through my actions anyway.

- I put less effort into making small, boring, positive choices.
- I allowed messes to pile up because, historically, I always *eventually* pulled off the last-minute recovery.
- I treated my ability to survive chaos as proof that it was okay to keep *allowing* chaos into the door.

My brain learned it could comfortably allow chaos. It reinforced the idea that it's fine to screw up, since, after all, "I'll screw up either way, my frontal lobe sucks." That's not a **neutral** narrative to live by; it's a *destructive* one.

Even if *I* can survive chaos, it's still my responsibility not to invite it into my life, and definitely not to drag **other people** into the fallout with me.

## Accountability: I Didn't Choose It, But I Own It

I never consciously decided that this pattern was right or virtuous. I didn't sit there and vote on it. But I also didn't fight it.

I didn't interrogate the lie early enough:

> "Since I'm going to fail anyway, it doesn't matter how hard I try."

That lie let me:
- Justify failures before they happen.
- Excuse my own shortcomings.
- Ignore how my behavior was affecting the people around me.

I was blind to the gap between who I wanted to be internally and how I was actually showing up externally. 

My ideals and my actions were out of sync, and I didn't push hard enough to bring them back into alignment.

That's on me.

## Habits as a Counterspell

Here's where the habit system comes in as a Counterspell.

ADHD makes it harder to:

- Focus
- Control impulses
- Sustain attention

Habits, on the other hand, are *automatic*. They don't ask your frontal lobe for permission to fire. Once a habit is wired in, our brains run it automatically. We no longer have to argue or convince ourselves every time. Our brain knows what to do; it's hard-wired to do so, and we don't need to force it.

The problem is that if we live in constant chaos, there's never enough stability to form positive and stable habits. Every time our brain tries to create a positive new pattern, something explodes and wipes the slate clean.

So we end up underusing the one system that could actually buffer us against our ADHD symptoms.

Now, to actually leverage habits, we need two things:

- Time without everything on fire.
- A willingness to do the small, boring, repeatable behaviors, long enough for them to hard-wire in place.

That means not defaulting to, "Well, I'll inevitably screw this up anyway," and instead purposefully *holding the line* for as long as possible.

## The Reframe: Delay Failure & Fall Gently

Dr. K discusses starting this shift with a cognitive reframe. The goal is not to pretend we'll never fail. We absolutely will screw things up. ADHD, trauma, anxiety, whatever you're working with, none of that disappears from writing or reading a pleasant paragraph about habits.

The reframe is this:
> "I'm going to *fight* to **delay** failure as long as ***possible***."

Not "I'll never fail," but:
- I will *act* toward solving the problem
- I will *buy* myself as much time as I can
- I will *refuse* to surrender early just because my brain is whispering that it's pointless.

There's a **huge** difference between:

- Failing *after* you've done everything you reasonably could, with systems and habits in place, and
- Failing *because* you gave up before the fight really started.

So many of my worst crashes weren't just about the fact that I failed. Failure itself is human and forgivable. The people around us understand that, and love us.

The real issue was how *hard* I failed.

I **didn't** fight to delay the failure. I **didn't** fight to fall as gently and as softly as possible. I *let* myself turn what could've been small slips into ***avalanches***, and those avalanches hurt me and hurt the people around me.

That's the part that is **not okay**.

My responsibility isn't to become a flawless, never-failing robot. My responsibility is to:
- Fight for my ideals as long as I can
- Take the small actions that soften any eventual fall
- Make sure that when I do mess up, the damage is something we can all recover from.

## Buying Time for Better Habits

The more we fight to *delay* failure, the more time we buy our brains.

Time for:
- Habits to solidify
- Routines to feel familiar
- The habit system to quietly take over some of the jobs our frontal lobe keeps dropping

Most of the time, it's not that I don't know what habits I *should* have. Most of the time, I know exactly what I need to do and what's right for me. The hard part has been acting towards those solutions when I'm afraid, uncertain, or tired of disappointment, and letting my emotional bias take the wheel.

But, every time we choose to act anyway, even if clumsily, it:
- Delays the chaos, even a little
- Gives our brains one more rep of the behavior we want reinforced
- Makes it a tiny bit easier for future us to do the right thing on autopilot

Every single time we act toward *anything*, our brain reinforces **that behavior**:
- If we act in response to chaos, the brain reinforces *responding to chaos*.
- If we avoid in response to fear, it reinforces *avoidance*.
- If we act in line with our values regardless of our state, it reinforces *acting in line with our values regardless of our state*.

## Momentum Cuts Both Ways

Human brains, especially neurodivergent ones, run on momentum. Once you start spiraling, it's very easy to keep going in that direction.

- If you're going down, it's easy to spiral downwards into shame, avoidance, and more chaos.
- But if you can force yourself to take even one small step upwards, it will get easier to take that next one, and the next one. You can spiral upwards, too.

The first step often feels like trash. It feels insignificant, pointless, and too late. But it's *not*. It's the step that will change the **direction** of the spiral.

My job, *my responsibility* to myself and the people around me, is to:
- Stop inviting chaos just because I know *I* may survive it.
- Fight to delay failure instead of *surrendering* to my feelings ahead of time.
- Take the small, unglamorous steps that buy my brain time to *reinforce* the habits and ideals I **truly value**, so they actually show up in ***actions*** over time.

I will still fail sometimes. ADHD will still win *some* battles. But I can make sure it has to fight for it. And when it does knock me down, I can make sure I've done the work to fall gently enough that I can stand back up *quickly*, instead of dragging myself, and everyone around me, down a **mountainside**.

The brain only wins if we stop fighting. It can scream, but it can't move our body. The only time the brain wins is when we hand it the steering wheel.
