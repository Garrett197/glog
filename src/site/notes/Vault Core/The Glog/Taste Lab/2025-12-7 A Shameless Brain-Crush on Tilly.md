## Responding To
**YouTube Video**: Redpiller vs. Feminist Debate Patriarchy — *Destiny*
![watch?v=q9ZGo2SNvAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9ZGo2SNvAA)

*Drafted 9:50 AM Thursday, December 4th, 2025*
*Revised & Published Sunday, December 7th, 2025*

Recently, Destiny moderated a debate between BlondePraxis (Tilly) and NoFugazee (Cooley) on the topic of patriarchy. Cooley is one of those stereotypical Red Pill guys who debates as if he's accustomed to his words being accepted as truth by default, e.g., acting with zero obligation to provide receipts. Tilly is a 20-year-old Cambridge student arguing for feminism and against patriarchy, and she absolutely *cooks* him.

It was difficult to watch the entire debate. Every time Cooley says something so plainly false, irrational, misogynistic, or fallacious, I gotta pause the video and debate my monitor just to exorcise the argument from my skull; I need to spell out *why* what he said was logically incoherent, or morally rotten, or both.

But every time I unpause, and Tilly gets to respond? ***Chef's kiss***. She's incredibly well-spoken, razor-precise, and absurdly good at cutting through Cooley's messy claims **while** building clean counterpoints in *real time*.

The only way Cooley survives a two-hour conversation with her is by ignoring, interrupting, or not understanding what she's saying, then returning to his pre-loaded flowchart script. He repeats the same lines, circles back to the same points after getting shut down, and loves to throw out classics like "You haven't proven anything," "That's just wrong," or "But my point still stands," while offering no actual backing for any of those statements.

I'm not here to re-litigate the entire debate. If you want to watch it, I'd recommend it, but be prepared for some high-friction epistemics. Tilly's brain is totally worth the price of admission, though. You may have seen her before, too; she had a viral clip when Charlie Kirk visited Cambridge, and she dismantles **him** there as well.

For this post, I want to zoom in on one section: the part where Destiny asks them to define a **right**, but it wouldn't be a Garrett post if I don't do a little self-reflection tangent first 😅

## A Quick Detour: Intent vs. Impact

Before I delve into the rights section, I'd like to share the internal process I went through when brainstorming the title for this post.

Most of the drive to write this comes explicitly from the excitement I felt watching Tilly argue; her communication is phenomenal, and her brain is exquisite to observe in action. 

So, I originally almost titled this post:

**"Huge Brain Boner for Tilly."**

Which was funny in my head, but… It's also precisely the problem.

If I'm writing about a woman absolutely bodying a sexist argument, the **last thing** I want to do is drop her back into the same "*lol she's hot tho*" objectification blender.

In my head, "brain boner" just meant: _I'm wildly excited by how sharp your thinking is._ But nobody else lives in my head. From the outside, it reads like one more guy watching a woman do high-level intellectual work and immediately dragging it back to sex.

In the past, I would've stopped at: _"Well, that's not what I meant!"_ 

**As if** intention was the ***whole story***

I'm putting more effort into watching what my words and actions actually **do** once they leave my mouth (or keyboard), regardless of what I *meant*. If something walks and quacks like casual objectification, it doesn't really matter that the source file in my brain was labeled "respect."

Having a messy or clumsy first thought doesn't make me secretly evil. It just makes me a person with a human brain. The part that carries moral weight is what I choose to do _next_. Brains are **loud** and ***chaotic***; they'll toss you memes, intrusive thoughts, and dumb jokes on autopilot. What matters is the decision tree after that: do I blurt it out and hide behind _"I didn't mean it like that, "_ or do I slow down and translate the impulse into an action that aligns with the person I claim I'm trying to be?

So I changed the title to:

**"A Shameless Brain-Crush on Tilly"**

That feels more accurate to what I actually mean: no objectification, no patronizing *' she's smart for a girl '* nonsense, just genuine awe at how ***clean*** her reasoning is.

This post is about how Tilly **thinks**, what I appreciate about her arguments, and what I'm absolutely stealing from her playbook 😈

## Defining A Right

This is the segment that I really want to focus on, since it's a true foundational element for this topic.

Destiny asks both debaters to define a **right**. Cooley goes first:

He says rights are a construct of the mind, we formulate do's and don'ts in our heads, and then men enforce those rights. A collection of men enforces those rights. Therefore, rights are just a construct of the mind.

That answer is not just weak. It's a *self-own* disguised as a definition;  buried inside it is a worldview that basically goes:

- Rights are whatever the dominant group *decides*.
- **Enforcement** is what makes something real.
- ***Men*** are the core enforcers.
- Therefore men are the ***authors and gatekeepers of rights***.

By his logic, **rights** become power’s *permission slip*.

This might describe how history has often behaved, but it does not tell us what a right **is** in any morally meaningful sense. The easiest stress test is slavery. The men of a society collectively decided they **could** own slaves, and they enforced it. Then a larger collection of men decided they ***couldn't*** , and that got enforced too.

So, Cooley's definition maps onto the *mechanics* of **domination**. But if that's our definition of rights... then the moral status of slavery becomes a weather report:

_"Looks like it's slave season, folks."_

This means Cooley, or anyone with this position, is implicitly gambling their own protection on the ongoing goodwill of whoever currently holds the biggest stick.

If we want a prosperous society where agency and experience are genuinely respected, this is a flawed way to define the most *fundamental* of moral claims a person **should** have.
### Tilly's Definition
Then Tilly drops a sentence so clean it should be framed:

"Rights are the minimal set of claims that each rational agent has to be able to make over themselves and over the world for a social contract to be possible — i.e., society."

Ugh... ***Beautiful***

Here's what she means in plain language:

Suppose we want a society, i.e., a group of rational beings with agency, choosing to live together under shared rules. In that case, there ***has to*** be a **minimum floor** of claims each one of those rational beings *must* be able to make about themselves, and the world. Rights do not describe the ideal version of morality; they represent the absolute baseline without which the entire social contract *collapses*.

So if something is a **right**, it's a claim that *must* be protected for society to function as a genuine agreement between agents, not a hostage situation ***branded*** as community. The right to life is the easiest example. If the "social contract" allows random murder, then we don't actually have a stable cooperative system. We have chaos with paperwork.

Tilly's framing also scales *beyond* humans. She's basically saying: any rational agents anywhere (humans, aliens, future AIs, whatever) would all **converge** on the same concepts. Different cultures may have different norms, values, and rules, but rights are the *minimal* set that all rational agents would ***need*** to make society possible in the first place.
### The enforcement derail

Cooley immediately responds to Tilly's claim with, "Ok, got it," but then pivots to:

"And who would enforce those rights?"

This is the flowchart showing up on schedule. The question at this moment is about what rights _are_ and what should **count** as rights. The enforcement method is a practical problem that only becomes relevant ***after*** we've defined the thing itself. 

Arguing enforcement before definition is like discussing how to store a substance we haven't even identified yet. 

Tilly catches the derail and asks what he's getting at — which is the polite version of: _Buddy, why are you trying to change the subject?_ 

Cooley then tries to play the "I'm just a humble high school guy, repeat your fancy Cambridge definition" card. It's just a rhetorical dodge: if you can't beat the definition, you try to muddy it, slow it down, and reframe the other person as unclear or elitist.

Tilly repeats herself, even **expands** it:

Rights are the minimal set of claims rational agents must be able to make over themselves and the world to mutually agree and bind themselves to a contract to *enter* society.

He responds:

"So then rights are a construction of the mind."

And she correctly says no. Under this view of rights, we're not inventing them as humans. Rights are the constraints that *any* rational agent would ***agree*** to put on themselves were they to enter society. 
### The math analogy

This is where she makes one of my favorite moves:

Tilly likens rights to structures like math, mathematical theorems, or even Nash's equilibrium: things we discover *through* reason rather than ***invent*** from scratch. The fact that we access them through reason doesn’t make them imaginary; it makes them the kind of thing that lives in shared rational structure. The point isn't that rights are physically measurable objects; Tilly's saying these are structures of rational coherence.

Cooley tries to counter with: but you can 'map' math onto reality, but you can't touch a right. Then Tilly replies with a line that's quietly devastating:

Maths are *norms of thought*, and rights are ***norms of action***.

Same category of thing, describing different realizations. There are both structures that underlie coherent reasoning **and** coherent cooperation. Just because I can't touch something, doesn't make it ***subjective***.

### A Vanishing Right through Violation

Cooley then reaches for an example: If I walk into a violent lawless space where no one recognizes my 'claimed rights' do I really have any of those rights?

This argument instantly falls. Just because your right to something is *violated* does not mean you cease to have that right as a rational agent. The existence of oppression is not evidence that rights do not exist. It's evidence that agents or institutions are breaking the moral minimum that is required for a ***legitimate*** social contract.

When women didn't have the right to vote in practice, it wasn't proof that they lacked the right in principle. It was proof that the society was immoral and structurally failing its own rational commitments.

Cooley's definition turns rights into "whatever is currently enforceable." Tilly's definition keeps rights tethered to the logic of mutual social existence.

That's a **massive** difference.
## Closing thought

Cooley attempts to use a description of how power has historically behaved as his guiding principle for establishing a just society. Tilly provides a definition of what rights are **for**, outlining the minimal conditions necessary for rational agents to live together under a *genuine* social contract.

Cooley stays trapped in enforcement. Tilly stays anchored to structure, and that's why this section is such a clean microcosm of the entire debate. One person is trying to describe the world as it has been under domination; the other is trying to articulate the conceptual **floor** required for a world that *deserves* to be called a society ***at all.***
