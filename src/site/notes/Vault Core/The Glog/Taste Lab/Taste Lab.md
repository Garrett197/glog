**YouTube Video**: Redpiller vs. Feminist Debate Patriarchy — *Destiny*
![watch?v=q9ZGo2SNvAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9ZGo2SNvAA)

---
*Drafted 9:50 AM Thursday, December 4th, 2025*
*Revised & Published Sunday, December 7th, 2025*

Recently, Destiny moderated a debate between BlondePraxis (Tilly) and NoFugazee (Cooley) on the topic of patriarchy. Cooley is one of those stereotypical Red Pill guys who debates as if he's accustomed to his words being accepted as truth by default, e.g., acting with zero obligation to provide receipts. Tilly is a 20-year-old Cambridge student arguing for feminism and against patriarchy, and she absolutely *cooks* him.

It was difficult to watch the entire debate. Every time Cooley says something so plainly false, irrational, misogynistic, or fallacious, I gotta pause the video and debate my monitor just to exorcise the argument from my skull; I need to spell out *why* what he said was logically incoherent, or morally rotten, or both.

But every time I unpause, and Tilly gets to respond? ***Chef's kiss***. She's incredibly well-spoken, razor-precise, and absurdly good at cutting through Cooley's messy claims **while** building clean counterpoints in *real time*.

The only way Cooley survives a two-hour conversation with her is by ignoring, interrupting, or not understanding what she's saying, then returning to his pre-loaded flowchart script. He repeats the same lines, circles back to the same points after getting shut down, and loves to throw out classics like "You haven't proven anything," "That's just wrong," or "But my point still stands," while offering no actual backing for any of those statements.

I'm not here to re-litigate the entire debate. If you want to watch it, I'd recommend it, but be prepared for some high-friction epistemics. Tilly's brain is totally worth the price of admission, though. You may have seen her before, too; she had a viral clip when Charlie Kirk visited Cambridge, and she dismantles **him** there as well.

For this post, I want to zoom in on one section: the part where Destiny asks them to define a **right**, but it wouldn't be a Garrett post if I don't do a little self-reflection tangent first 😅

## A Quick Detour: Intent vs. Impact

Before I delve into the rights section, I'd like to share the internal process I went through when brainstorming the title for this post.

Most of the drive to write this comes explicitly from the excitement I felt watching Tilly argue; her communication is phenomenal, and her brain is exquisite to observe in action. 

So, I originally almost titled this post:

**"Huge Brain Boner for Tilly."**

Which was funny in my head, but… It's also precisely the problem.

If I'm writing about a woman absolutely bodying a sexist argument, the **last thing** I want to do is drop her back into the same "*lol she's hot tho*" objectification blender.

In my head, "brain boner" just meant: _I'm wildly excited by how sharp your thinking is._ But nobody else lives in my head. From the outside, it reads like one more guy watching a woman do high-level intellectual work and immediately dragging it back to sex.

In the past, I would've stopped at: _"Well, that's not what I meant!"_ 

**As if** intention was the ***whole story***

I'm putting more effort into watching what my words and actions actually **do** once they leave my mouth (or keyboard), regardless of what I *meant*. If something walks and quacks like casual objectification, it doesn't really matter that the source file in my brain was labeled "respect."

Having a messy or clumsy first thought doesn't make me secretly evil. It just makes me a person with a human brain. The part that carries moral weight is what I choose to do _next_. Brains are **loud** and ***chaotic***; they'll toss you memes, intrusive thoughts, and dumb jokes on autopilot. What matters is the decision tree after that: do I blurt it out and hide behind _"I didn't mean it like that, "_ or do I slow down and translate the impulse into an action that aligns with the person I claim I'm trying to be?

So I changed the title to:

**"A Shameless Brain-Crush on Tilly"**

That feels more accurate to what I actually mean: no objectification, no patronizing *' she's smart for a girl '* nonsense, just genuine awe at how ***clean*** her reasoning is.

This post is about how Tilly **thinks**, what I appreciate about her arguments, and what I'm absolutely stealing from her playbook 😈

## Defining A Right

This is the segment that I really want to focus on, since it's a true foundational element for this topic.

Destiny asks both debaters to define a **right**. Cooley goes first:

He says rights are a construct of the mind, we formulate do's and don'ts in our heads, and then men enforce those rights. A collection of men enforces those rights. Therefore, rights are just a construct of the mind.

That answer is not just weak. It's a *self-own* disguised as a definition;  buried inside it is a worldview that basically goes:

- Rights are whatever the dominant group *decides*.
- **Enforcement** is what makes something real.
- ***Men*** are the core enforcers.
- Therefore men are the ***authors and gatekeepers of rights***.

By his logic, **rights** become power’s *permission slip*.

This might describe how history has often behaved, but it does not tell us what a right **is** in any morally meaningful sense. The easiest stress test is slavery. The men of a society collectively decided they **could** own slaves, and they enforced it. Then a larger collection of men decided they ***couldn't*** , and that got enforced too.

So, Cooley's definition maps onto the *mechanics* of **domination**. But if that's our definition of rights... then the moral status of slavery becomes a weather report:

_"Looks like it's slave season, folks."_

This means Cooley, or anyone with this position, is implicitly gambling their own protection on the ongoing goodwill of whoever currently holds the biggest stick.

If we want a prosperous society where agency and experience are genuinely respected, this is a flawed way to define the most *fundamental* of moral claims a person **should** have.
### Tilly's Definition
Then Tilly drops a sentence so clean it should be framed:

"Rights are the minimal set of claims that each rational agent has to be able to make over themselves and over the world for a social contract to be possible — i.e., society."

Ugh... ***Beautiful***

Here's what she means in plain language:

Suppose we want a society, i.e., a group of rational beings with agency, choosing to live together under shared rules. In that case, there ***has to*** be a **minimum floor** of claims each one of those rational beings *must* be able to make about themselves, and the world. Rights do not describe the ideal version of morality; they represent the absolute baseline without which the entire social contract *collapses*.

So if something is a **right**, it's a claim that *must* be protected for society to function as a genuine agreement between agents, not a hostage situation ***branded*** as community. The right to life is the easiest example. If the "social contract" allows random murder, then we don't actually have a stable cooperative system. We have chaos with paperwork.

Tilly's framing also scales *beyond* humans. She's basically saying: any rational agents anywhere (humans, aliens, future AIs, whatever) would all **converge** on the same concepts. Different cultures may have different norms, values, and rules, but rights are the *minimal* set that all rational agents would ***need*** to make society possible in the first place.
### The enforcement derail

Cooley immediately responds to Tilly's claim with, "Ok, got it," but then pivots to:

"And who would enforce those rights?"

This is the flowchart showing up on schedule. The question at this moment is about what rights _are_ and what should **count** as rights. The enforcement method is a practical problem that only becomes relevant ***after*** we've defined the thing itself. 

Arguing enforcement before definition is like discussing how to store a substance we haven't even identified yet. 

Tilly catches the derail and asks what he's getting at — which is the polite version of: _Buddy, why are you trying to change the subject?_ 

Cooley then tries to play the "I'm just a humble high school guy, repeat your fancy Cambridge definition" card. It's just a rhetorical dodge: if you can't beat the definition, you try to muddy it, slow it down, and reframe the other person as unclear or elitist.

Tilly repeats herself, even **expands** it:

Rights are the minimal set of claims rational agents must be able to make over themselves and the world to mutually agree and bind themselves to a contract to *enter* society.

He responds:

"So then rights are a construction of the mind."

And she correctly says no. Under this view of rights, we're not inventing them as humans. Rights are the constraints that *any* rational agent would ***agree*** to put on themselves were they to enter society. 
### The math analogy

This is where she makes one of my favorite moves:

Tilly likens rights to structures like math, mathematical theorems, or even Nash's equilibrium: things we discover *through* reason rather than ***invent*** from scratch. The fact that we access them through reason doesn’t make them imaginary; it makes them the kind of thing that lives in shared rational structure. The point isn't that rights are physically measurable objects; Tilly's saying these are structures of rational coherence.

Cooley tries to counter with: but you can 'map' math onto reality, but you can't touch a right. Then Tilly replies with a line that's quietly devastating:

Maths are *norms of thought*, and rights are ***norms of action***.

Same category of thing, describing different realizations. There are both structures that underlie coherent reasoning **and** coherent cooperation. Just because I can't touch something, doesn't make it ***subjective***.

### A Vanishing Right through Violation

Cooley then reaches for an example: If I walk into a violent lawless space where no one recognizes my 'claimed rights' do I really have any of those rights?

This argument instantly falls. Just because your right to something is *violated* does not mean you cease to have that right as a rational agent. The existence of oppression is not evidence that rights do not exist. It's evidence that agents or institutions are breaking the moral minimum that is required for a ***legitimate*** social contract.

When women didn't have the right to vote in practice, it wasn't proof that they lacked the right in principle. It was proof that the society was immoral and structurally failing its own rational commitments.

Cooley's definition turns rights into "whatever is currently enforceable." Tilly's definition keeps rights tethered to the logic of mutual social existence.

That's a **massive** difference.
## Closing thought

Cooley attempts to use a description of how power has historically behaved as his guiding principle for establishing a just society. Tilly provides a definition of what rights are **for**, outlining the minimal conditions necessary for rational agents to live together under a *genuine* social contract.

Cooley stays trapped in enforcement. Tilly stays anchored to structure, and that's why this section is such a clean microcosm of the entire debate. One person is trying to describe the world as it has been under domination; the other is trying to articulate the conceptual **floor** required for a world that *deserves* to be called a society ***at all.***

*1:51 PM Friday, November 28th, 2025*

I think *Nights in White Satin* by The Moody Blues is a phenomenal song, and every time I listen to it I feel like I'm dropped back into its emotional world.

Justin Hayward wrote it when he was 19, right at the end of one intense relationship and on the edge of another. You can feel that "in-between" state all over the track: it isn't clean heartbreak or clean new love, it's both stacked on top of each other and vibrating.

The title comes from something very concrete: a set of white satin bedsheets his girlfriend bought him. Those sheets became a strong sensory hook for everything he was going through. So when Hayward sings about "nights in white satin," it isn't just a nice phrase, it was literal nights spent tangled in those sheets while the emotional storm in his head refused to calm down.

The lyrics are deliberately vague and floaty. They don't walk you through a neat narrative; they drop you into feelings: confusion, longing, romantic obsession, uncertainty, and that sense that reality and fantasy are starting to blur. The line "Just what the truth is, I can't say anymore" nails that moment when you're so deep in it you can't fully trust your own perceptions anymore.

The music itself pulls you into that headspace. The slow tempo and minor-key harmony keep everything suspended, like the night never quite ends. The mix of Mellotron-style strings and that famous flute interlude makes the song feel weightless and dreamlike, which fits that half-awake, can't-stop-thinking kind of heartbreak.

Then there's "Late Lament," the spoken-word poem that often closes the piece. Written by drummer Graeme Edge and usually recited by keyboardist Mike Pinder over the central orchestral backing, it zooms out from one person's heartbreak to something more cosmic: day and night, illusion and reality, what's "right" and what's only in our minds. It feels like the philosophical afterimage of the song; the thoughts that show up after the crying, when the feelings are quieting down but your brain is still spinning.

I first really connected with the song through the cover by Dan Avidan & Super Guitar Bros, which I love. Dan's voice fits the drama of the lyrics really well, and the all-guitar arrangement shifts the tone a bit. Where the original leans into foggy, orchestral, "endless night" energy, the cover feels more intimate, like someone quietly playing this confession in your living room. It doesn't replace the Moody Blues version for me; it just gives me a second lens to experience the same emotional core through.

**YouTube Video**: Does ADHD Feel Like A Curse? Do This. - Dr. K
![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq6K7yxaNaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq6K7yxaNaM "Dr. K - Does ADHD Feel Like A Curse? Do This.")

---
*12:38 PM Thursday, November 27th, 2025*

Recently, I watched a Dr. K video on ADHD, and one idea hit me like a truck: a lot of the pain of ADHD doesn't just come from the part of our brains that *doesn't* work well. A massive part of ADHD struggles comes from us **not using** a part of our brain that *does* work well.

In other words, it's not *only* "my brain is broken," it's also "I've been **leaning** on the wrong system." That realization explains a great deal about how I've been running my life.

## The Model: ADHD, The Frontal Lobe, and Habits

Here's a brief overview of the working model Dr. K talks about:

> [!Warning] Disclaimer
> This isn't the full neuroscience story, but as a working model for how ADHD feels from the inside, it fits scarily well.

- ADHD hits the **frontal lobe**, the part of the brain that handles focus, impulse control, planning, and sustained attention.
- There's another system in our brain, the habit system, that runs on different brain circuits with different neurotransmitters.
- Habits are automatic behaviors. They don't need much conscious focus or willpower once they're wired in. They just fire.

Growing up with ADHD, we tend to run into the same wall over and over:
- We may *know* what we're supposed to do.
- We may *try* to get organized, stay on top of things, and be responsible.
- And yet, usually we still drop the ball, miss deadlines, forget the important stuff, and watch everything we care about slowly slide out of our hands.

This consistent loop of trying ­→ failing → trying → failing, teaches our brain something awful: *no matter how hard I try, I screw it up anyway.*

At that point, we're not just dealing with ADHD; we're dealing with the **fear of failure** stacked on top of ADHD. We're so worried about failing that we *burn* what little focus we have on the possibility of failure instead of *using* it on the thing we're trying not to mess up. We become our own self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Damage Control vs. Damage Prevention

Here's the cursed superpower ADHD brings to the table: we are often really good at damage control and really bad at damage prevention.

When everything is on fire, when there are 17 deadlines in 24 hours and 14 things that have gone catastrophically wrong, the ADHD brain can suddenly lock in. All those years of last-minute scrambling, barely pulling things together, and **still surviving** that chaos due to last-minute 'lock-ins' taught our brains something dangerous:

> "If I'm going to screw up anyway, I might as well screw it up now, and create the chaos I'm good at surviving."

The brain learns that chaos is familiar. Chaos is where we've proven we can show up and perform. Prevention feels way more labor-intensive for our brains than cleanup, so we quietly start tolerating, and sometimes inviting, the mess.

I've never sat myself down and said, "Alright, Garrett, it's totally fine if you wreck this, because your brain is weird and you'll just heroically fix it later." But in practice? I've lived that philosophy through my actions anyway.

- I put less effort into making small, boring, positive choices.
- I allowed messes to pile up because, historically, I always *eventually* pulled off the last-minute recovery.
- I treated my ability to survive chaos as proof that it was okay to keep *allowing* chaos into the door.

My brain learned it could comfortably allow chaos. It reinforced the idea that it's fine to screw up, since, after all, "I'll screw up either way, my frontal lobe sucks." That's not a **neutral** narrative to live by; it's a *destructive* one.

Even if *I* can survive chaos, it's still my responsibility not to invite it into my life, and definitely not to drag **other people** into the fallout with me.

## Accountability: I Didn't Choose It, But I Own It

I never consciously decided that this pattern was right or virtuous. I didn't sit there and vote on it. But I also didn't fight it.

I didn't interrogate the lie early enough:

> "Since I'm going to fail anyway, it doesn't matter how hard I try."

That lie let me:
- Justify failures before they happen.
- Excuse my own shortcomings.
- Ignore how my behavior was affecting the people around me.

I was blind to the gap between who I wanted to be internally and how I was actually showing up externally. 

My ideals and my actions were out of sync, and I didn't push hard enough to bring them back into alignment.

That's on me.

## Habits as a Counterspell

Here's where the habit system comes in as a Counterspell.

ADHD makes it harder to:

- Focus
- Control impulses
- Sustain attention

Habits, on the other hand, are *automatic*. They don't ask your frontal lobe for permission to fire. Once a habit is wired in, our brains run it automatically. We no longer have to argue or convince ourselves every time. Our brain knows what to do; it's hard-wired to do so, and we don't need to force it.

The problem is that if we live in constant chaos, there's never enough stability to form positive and stable habits. Every time our brain tries to create a positive new pattern, something explodes and wipes the slate clean.

So we end up underusing the one system that could actually buffer us against our ADHD symptoms.

Now, to actually leverage habits, we need two things:

- Time without everything on fire.
- A willingness to do the small, boring, repeatable behaviors, long enough for them to hard-wire in place.

That means not defaulting to, "Well, I'll inevitably screw this up anyway," and instead purposefully *holding the line* for as long as possible.

## The Reframe: Delay Failure & Fall Gently

Dr. K discusses starting this shift with a cognitive reframe. The goal is not to pretend we'll never fail. We absolutely will screw things up. ADHD, trauma, anxiety, whatever you're working with, none of that disappears from writing or reading a pleasant paragraph about habits.

The reframe is this:
> "I'm going to *fight* to **delay** failure as long as ***possible***."

Not "I'll never fail," but:
- I will *act* toward solving the problem
- I will *buy* myself as much time as I can
- I will *refuse* to surrender early just because my brain is whispering that it's pointless.

There's a **huge** difference between:

- Failing *after* you've done everything you reasonably could, with systems and habits in place, and
- Failing *because* you gave up before the fight really started.

So many of my worst crashes weren't just about the fact that I failed. Failure itself is human and forgivable. The people around us understand that, and love us.

The real issue was how *hard* I failed.

I **didn't** fight to delay the failure. I **didn't** fight to fall as gently and as softly as possible. I *let* myself turn what could've been small slips into ***avalanches***, and those avalanches hurt me and hurt the people around me.

That's the part that is **not okay**.

My responsibility isn't to become a flawless, never-failing robot. My responsibility is to:
- Fight for my ideals as long as I can
- Take the small actions that soften any eventual fall
- Make sure that when I do mess up, the damage is something we can all recover from.

## Buying Time for Better Habits

The more we fight to *delay* failure, the more time we buy our brains.

Time for:
- Habits to solidify
- Routines to feel familiar
- The habit system to quietly take over some of the jobs our frontal lobe keeps dropping

Most of the time, it's not that I don't know what habits I *should* have. Most of the time, I know exactly what I need to do and what's right for me. The hard part has been acting towards those solutions when I'm afraid, uncertain, or tired of disappointment, and letting my emotional bias take the wheel.

But, every time we choose to act anyway, even if clumsily, it:
- Delays the chaos, even a little
- Gives our brains one more rep of the behavior we want reinforced
- Makes it a tiny bit easier for future us to do the right thing on autopilot

Every single time we act toward *anything*, our brain reinforces **that behavior**:
- If we act in response to chaos, the brain reinforces *responding to chaos*.
- If we avoid in response to fear, it reinforces *avoidance*.
- If we act in line with our values regardless of our state, it reinforces *acting in line with our values regardless of our state*.

## Momentum Cuts Both Ways

Human brains, especially neurodivergent ones, run on momentum. Once you start spiraling, it's very easy to keep going in that direction.

- If you're going down, it's easy to spiral downwards into shame, avoidance, and more chaos.
- But if you can force yourself to take even one small step upwards, it will get easier to take that next one, and the next one. You can spiral upwards, too.

The first step often feels like trash. It feels insignificant, pointless, and too late. But it's *not*. It's the step that will change the **direction** of the spiral.

My job, *my responsibility* to myself and the people around me, is to:
- Stop inviting chaos just because I know *I* may survive it.
- Fight to delay failure instead of *surrendering* to my feelings ahead of time.
- Take the small, unglamorous steps that buy my brain time to *reinforce* the habits and ideals I **truly value**, so they actually show up in ***actions*** over time.

I will still fail sometimes. ADHD will still win *some* battles. But I can make sure it has to fight for it. And when it does knock me down, I can make sure I've done the work to fall gently enough that I can stand back up *quickly*, instead of dragging myself, and everyone around me, down a **mountainside**.

The brain only wins if we stop fighting. It can scream, but it can't move our body. The only time the brain wins is when we hand it the steering wheel.
