# Analyzing my taste
*4:20 PM Monday, November 24th, 2025*

Hey guys. This is my first glog post, and part of my brain keeps insisting that the first one has to be fully realized and special before I'm "allowed" to post it. The perfectionist part of my brain really wants me to overthink this into oblivion. 

That pattern isn't actually helpful though. The only way for the glog to become what I want it to be is by actually *using* it. I have to post, then I can upgrade it. I can't predict everything I'll eventually want to change, but I *can* find out by working on it in public, instead of keeping it in my head forever.

So for this post, I'm pretending this isn't "the first one." It's just *a* post. If I try to over-engineer my introduction, I know I'll never hit publish.

### Clothing as a Physical Manifestation of Taste

This morning I was mapping out a vision for a new wardrobe. 

For most of my life, I've put almost zero thought into my clothes or appearance. Old thought patterns (likely amplified by ADHD) made style feel like a waste of time and energy. My body just felt bored, hopeless, or lost anytime I tried to "do fashion."

But after a bunch of life events and growth, I'm in a different spot. I don't just *want* to put effort into my outfits now, I'm actively building a life where that effort is actually realistic day to day. The motivation is there *and* I'm setting up the conditions to act on it.

While I was researching clothes and catching up on basic style knowledge I'd been ignoring for years, I started thinking about what kind of designs I may want for my shirts.

I knew this much:
- I want shirts that each hold some unique value to me; graphics that feel personally enthralling.
- I want stuff that fits the alt vibe, *and* expresses my taste at the same time.

Sure, I could grab a bunch of plain black or muted shirts and look decent with some jeans. But then I'm not really expressing *me*, it's more like I'm merely expressing "alt fundamentals." Fundamentals are just foundations, you build *from* them, not *only* with them.

So, I needed a way to organize my taste. I needed to ask myself, "what are the actual 'buckets' of things I'm into that I'd want on my clothing?"

For Example:
I love **Attack on Titan**. If I found a dark, subtle, aesthetic AOT shirt that fits me well, that wouldn't just look good and match my vibe, it would be a *uniquely* me piece that coherently fits into my overall wardrobe.

The wardrobe becomes a physical manifestation of taste. My job is to make sure that my *actual* taste is what shows up in the fabric, not just whatever's lying around in my drawers, or the first thing I see at a store.


### Naming the Perfectionism Loop
BUT THEN! My brain threw a question at me: 

> "Okay, but how do I unify or understand what my taste is? How do I actually translate the vibes I feel into words and real clothing.

I can feel when something matches my taste. If I see it, I know. However, I can't just wander through life hoping items randomly spawn that suddenly "spark." I need a way to *manufacture* that feeling on purpose.

So I started by listing all the things I'm into that I could think of. No structure, just brain dumping. I didn't instantly start the dump, I sat and stirred for a while because it all felt like too much or I just wouldn't get it right.

This sequence kinda mimics exactly what happened when I got the urge to write the glog post in the first place.

- Desire for outcome
- Perfectionistic hesitation and overthinking
- Acceptance that it won't be perfect
- Acting towards my desired outcome regardless

I wasn't consciously narrating that at the time, but I *was* interrupting a harmful perfectionism loop in both cases, which is kinda cool.

My brain really wants me to sit and endlessly plan, research, analyze, and prepare so that by the time I do anything, it's perfect. That part of my brain is scared and trying to protect me. 

It believes with complete conviction:
- If we start and it isn't perfect I'm going to get hurt.
- I'm going to judge and doubt myself.
- Other people will also see it sucks or it's not perfect and they'll judge me too.

The protective system only has access to fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. None of those actions aligned with what **I**, the observer & experiencer, actually value. And in this situation, there isn't even a real threat to respond to.
- I'm not currently attacking myself
- I'm not being flamed or critisized
- My worth as a person isn't based on whether someone thinks this post is "mid."

The system *thinks* that's happening, so it feeds me garbage. Its tools are harmful, and it's threat analysis is dead wrong. The way through is this:

Look at the pattern. Name it. See it as a *system*, not **me**. Then choose how you want to respond. The choice is unavoidable. You either end up being the person who obeyed the fear, or the person who didn't. There's no avoiding it. So choose.

### Booting Up the Brain: Interest Mapping
Anyway, back to the clothes.

I started writing out all the different things I'm into, and then I just stared at the list and pondered. A lot of the early pondering is like "booting up my PC" so my ADHD brain can ground itself in the info I can't instantly see all at once.

I have re-load:

- The symbolism in AOT
- The emotional arc of Hit Me Hard and Soft
- The plot and characters of Undertale
- The vibes and aesthetic of Cryalot's Icarus, etc.

Once I really sat inside those pieces of media, and more I'm not completely listing out, and let myself feel them again, I started seeing connections I'd never notice before.

Previously I just assumed:
"I'm an enjoyer. Good media is good, and I like it. That's it."

Why does one thing wreck me emotionally while another barely touches me? "Who Knows :))))))"

That was the old, absent-minded version of me; same as how I used to move through fashion, same as how I used to move through many things.

But as I saw more connections, I got this huge wave of excitement and dopamine. It felt like seeing myself behind the curtain. On the surface, my taste is a bunch of separate titles and aesthetics. Underneath, there are recurring themes and emotional patterns my brain keepis falling in love with.

So here's what I noticed, and maybe I'm seeing constellations in random dots, but honestly? It's fun either way! : D

#### Theme 1: Duality

Two Opposite things held together at once:
- Light vs. Dark
- Hope vs. Despair
- Human vs. Monster
- Machine vs. Man
- Sanity vs. Madness

You can see this all over:
- Attack on Titan - Freedom vs. Slavery, Human vs. Titan, Monster vs. Savior.
- Mr. Robot - Rationality vs. Chaos, Sanity vs. Breakdown, Self vs. Alter-Self
- Undertale & Celeste - Determination *and* struggle; effort *and* failure; falling apart *and* getting back up; it's always both.

These stories are built out of duality. As a viewer, you don't just *watch* the conflict, you can *feel* the internal struggle. You have to wrestle with the duality in your own head, and those internal waves are what hook me.

#### Theme 2: Tech / Glitches / System Energy
Aesthetically, there's a loud pattern too. A lot of what I love hits this Tech / Gitchy / System Energy vein.

Think:
- Cyberpunk Edges
- Glitch Art
- HUD Overlays
- Console/Terminal Vibes
- Digital Noise, Neon, Corrupted Screens

It's not like everything I like is textbook "cyberpunk," but colors, layouts, sounds, and textures from that vibe resonate with me over and over. Techy menus, Weird UIs, Distorted systems, that whole family of visuals and sounds makes my brain light up good.

#### Theme 3: Psych Themes & Emotional Intensity
I'm also very drawn toward psychology and raw emotional intensity.

I like media that:
- Dives into mental health and messy inner worlds
- Shows chaotic ups and downs instead of clean linear arcs
- Lets characters be deeply flawed and still human

I care a lot about the human experience. I've had my share of deep pits, but I'm on the other side of a lot of them now. Those moments don't *define* me. I am not the pain; I am not the impact; I am the one who *experienced* it.

Same with urges and actions:
- I feel the urge
- I notice the urge
- I choose what to *do* with the feeling
Even if I choose wrong, I'm still the observer and experiencer, not the choice, and not the feeling.

That ability to bring awareness to the state of our minds and then decide what to do is insanely rare and special. All humans have this, meta-cognition is what makes our species what it is. Animals act as the animal. Their brian fires, and they respond. 

But Humans Get:
- Brain systems firing
- Feelings arising
- Thoughts commenting on those feelings.
- The ability to choose a response.

That's nuts. I feel so lucky to have this experience at all, even when it's painful or "less than optimal." I don't want to spend my entire life fighting and screaming whenever I feel something hard. I'd rather look for the value in that experience, the growth it can fuel, and the beauty of the mess.

When music, games, stories, or shows let me experience a version of someone else's internal chaos in a vivid way, that's incredibly valuable to me. That's what being human is all about.

#### Theme 4: Symbolic & Classical Obsessions
Last thread for today: my fascination with symbolic and classical stuff.

Things like:
- Roman History
- Chemistry
- Ancient Philosophy
- Foundational Truths (Across Disciplines)

Even if I can't instantly list every example or cross connect this theme to the other pieces of media I've mentioned so far, this "classical + fundamental" category just of feels right in my bones.

When something is:
- Historical
- Foundational
- Structurally important
... it just feels like it matters more. I'm not making a reason based decision that it values more, but I can't deny that my brain and body feel it more.

Describing the universe and reality in terms of atoms and molecules? That hits in a way nothing did before. Reading about early philosophers trying to may the mind with no modern tools and nothing but thought? That hits too.

It's like watching the source code of human understanding slowly get written.

### Wrapping it Up
Okay I think that's probably enough for this post.

There's no grand thesis here or some huge announcement really, just some observations about my own taste that got my excited and motivated me to write. Mapping my interests out like this makes it easier for me to design things (My bedroom, My wardrobe, The Glog) that actually feel like me instead of just borrowing aesthetics from the internet or strictly following a set of arbitrary rules.

If any part of this thought process resonated with you, that's sick, if not, that's cool too. This is mostly me leaving breadcrumbs so Future Me can look back and see how my brain was wired at this time, and how it might change as time passes. Hope you got some enjoyment out of it < 3
