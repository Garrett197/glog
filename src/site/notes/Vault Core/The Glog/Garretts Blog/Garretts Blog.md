# Anxiety & Somatic Lag

One of my biggest personal mental health struggles is anxiety. Anxiety is a pretty commonly used term and honestly pretty vague by itself, so I want to dial in on exactly what I experience, and how I interpret anxiety based on my current understanding of myself and psychology/neuroscience.

This is mainly a snapshot, not a textbook. I'm working through the thought process and giving future-me something to look back on later, to see how my perceptions and understandings have evolved over time.


> [!NOTE] Map vs. Territory
> This whole post is kind of like a **map** of how I currently think my anxiety works. It does *not* prove anything by itself.
> 
> The only proof that any of this matters is in how I actually behave over the following weeks, months, and years, especially in the moments where my anxiety is screaming to let it take over.

## Defining Anxiety in System Terms

In the simplest terms, anxiety is the over-activation of the amygdala; it's way too trigger-happy. In reality, clinical anxiety is more of a network thing describing dysfunction across multiple systems in the brain: the amygdala is extra reactive *and* the prefrontal cortex has a harder time calming it down. However, for the sake of aligning ourselves with its colloquial usage and having a character in this story, Ms. Amy G. Dala is the leading player.

Let's zoom in and demystify things. The amygdala isn't like a separate little grape glued onto the rest of your brain. It's the name we give to a small, almond-shaped region of nuclei (little cell neighborhoods) right alongside the larger city of 'the brain'. The specific functionality of *your* amygdala varies greatly; it depends on how the cells there are arranged, what types of cells they are, and who they're wired together with.

Most of the cells in your brain are neurons. Neuron cell-body zones are referred to as **gray matter**. The amygdala is just a region of gray matter, but this *specific* gray matter region, deep in the medial temporal lobe, has distinct cell-wiring patterns compared to surrounding tissue, which makes it repeatedly identifiable as the **amygdala**.

Now, neurons themselves are just really long, skinny cells. Each individual neuron is designed to receive specific inputs and produce particular outputs, accomplishing this through chemical processes. Neurons stretch all across the brain and use chemistry to:

- Take in input from around them.
- Bind with neurotransmitters floating in the synaptic cleft (open space between neurons).
- Respond by sending electrical signals forward.

Those electrical signals then travel and interact with other cells, which respond to the input, and voilà! Those *chained* reactions are your biosystems.

Specifically, the neurons wired throughout the amygdala receive input from multiple other brain regions. 

For example:

> Fearful visual input (maybe a spider) → Optic System → Visual Thalamus → Visual Cortex → Amygdala → Output signals to feel fight, flight, freeze, fawn.

This whole sequence is extremely fast. If your brain already has strong pathways that say "when I see X, we panic," you don't get to calmly *decide* whether to be scared, you just *are*.

That's great for survival. If a snake is about to bite you, you don't want to ponder through the philosophical cost-benefit analysis; you want your legs to *move*. But in modern life, most of the "threats" around us are not actually life-or-death emergencies. Reality is relatively calm most of the time, and our prefrontal cortex (the logic/planning system) usually does a better job advising us than our amygdala.

There are a few problems, though:

1. **Your brain-as-machinery doesn't 'know' reality is chill.**
	- You, as the conscious observer, might know the situation is safe, but the low-level wiring in your brain only sees input and patterns. It tries its best with what it's been taught, even if that teaching is outdated or harmful.
2. **The prefrontal cortex is VERY resource-intensive**
	- Logic and reasoning are ***hard***. There's a TON of complicated wiring and signaling going on when we spin up the 'problem-solving' system. If the brain doesn't have the necessary resources (such as sleep, food, and water) to process logic, it's not our fault if we can't perceive certain truths or make certain connections.
3. **Stress chemistry temporarily nerfs the logic system**
	- When the amygdala fires and our sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight wiring) lights up, stress chemicals make the prefrontal cortex way worse at its job. It's like the brain literally taking processing power *away* from "slow, careful thinking" and dumping it *into* "fast reflexes and raw sensations." That not only makes it harder to process reality accurately, but it also significantly intensifies the sensations we feel during the fight/flight/freeze/fawn response.

It's easy to see how anxiety can become extremely debilitating. We're just trying to go through life, be happy, and make good choices. However, our own biology can make it harder to think clearly and can flood us with intense, unnecessary fear.

So how do we get to these overactive states in the first place? Not everyone has an anxiety disorder. Why do some brains wire this way?

## Trauma, Triggers, and a Trying Brain

Trauma is a term that is often used loosely. It has some stigma on one side and some overuse on the other, but it's an essential concept if you care about mental health or self-growth.

From the outside, trauma is:

> An experience of emotional or physical threat that overwhelms your sense of safety and ability to cope with reality, and leaves you with lingering thought patterns, intrusive memories or thoughts, avoidance, hyper-alertness, etc.

From the *inside* of the brain, trauma looks like:

> The fear circuits get tuned to fire faster, louder, and more often. 
> The brain *rewires*.

If you repeatedly experience something very intense or fierce, your brain may respond by updating its neural connections. That's just your brain trying to protect you. We don't need to be mad at our brains; the amygdala exists for a reason, and it is really doing its best... but its best is not always helpful.

Often, people who live through something traumatic develop certain behaviors to cope with it:

- Dissociating.
- Yelling back.
- Shrinking or fawning.
- Escaping into drugs.
- Running away.
- etc.

The problem is, the behaviors, feelings, and thought patterns that help someone survive a traumatic time often don't magically vanish once the danger is over. They leak out into future situations that are *not* dangerous.

You may go through a challenging life event, but you can move on and not continually re-experience it. In that case, it was a painful memory, not trauma in this *wiring*-sense.

Trauma, in the sense I'm talking about, is when your brain learns a pattern during an overwhelming time and then fails to undo it afterward. So, you continue to carry the fear response into moments where it no longer belongs.

Example:
- Your parents constantly yelled at you as a kid.
- Your brain adapted by wiring "being yelled at" = "we are under attack."
- Years later, when anyone raises their voice, even in a game or as a joke, your brain still runs the old program.
- It doesn't know *this* yelling is different. All it sees is "we've had this input thousands of times; I got this bro, I know what to do."

That's actually a kind of brutal efficiency. Your brain got so good at recognizing that pattern that it can instantly generate a strong reaction in under a second. The downside is obvious: the pattern is now overgeneralized, and firing in the wrong situations.

Let's define another word that's been dragged through the mud a bit too:

> [!NOTE] Trigger
> A *trigger* is any stimulus your brain interprets as similar enough to the traumatic event that it fires the same fear-response sequence it's used to.

In this yelling example, being yelled at is the trigger.

**KEY:** It's ***necessary*** to detach morality from triggers.

- Getting triggered is *not* a character flaw.
- Having certain triggers does *not* make you "weak."
- The person who "triggered" you in the present is *not* automatically evil.

All it really means is: your brain, at some point, believed specific wiring would best protect you, and it's still using that same wiring.

You may feel hurt, anxious, or highly emotional when a trigger hits. That absolutely sucks. I'm sorry if anyone feels that way. I've been there and still deal with it on a day-to-day basis. The only thing we can do is acknowledge that our feelings are feelings, that they are not inherently harmful on their own, and we will not let them take control of us.

The only way that feeling starts to tilt your life off course is when it consistently dictates your behavior. 

Crucial Nuance:

> It is often our behavior *during and after* the traumatic time that teaches the brain **what** to wire.
> That does *NOT* mean that the trauma or wiring is your fault.
> It means your brain learned from whatever happened. What was done to you, what you did to survive, and what you did afterward.

Suppose the only way you knew to cope with childhood abuse was by dissociating or yelling back. In that case, your brain will gradually wire itself to make dissociating or yelling back the easiest, most automatic thing to do when it detects "similar enough" situations.

Your conscious mind did not sit down and vote for this. The wiring just quietly did its job.
## Brain Cable Management

Remember, your brain is on your team. It's not out to get you. It simply lacks access to the same level of awareness that you, the observer, possess.

It's insanely malleable. Literally any repeated action you take, your brain will try to make easier to repeat.

That is a blessing and a curse.

- If you wake up and run every morning, it will eventually get easier to make running in the morning less miserable.
- If you shout every time you're criticized, it will lead to making shouting the default option.

All feelings, in this model, can be seen as the brain's attempt to motivate you:

- The brain has access to tools like neurotransmitters, hormones, and body sensations.
- You, the conscious observer, have access to tools like meta-cognition and choice.

When we feel stuff, we're usually motivated to act:
- Chase the good sensations.
- Escape and prevent the bad ones.

But the brain cannot actually force you to do anything; it can only generate urges, cravings, fears, or impulses. The brain is forced to use these tools to communicate with you, since only *you* can choose what you **do**.

> [!Tip] State vs. Values
> Feelings + external events = state. The state is always temporary.
> What you care about long-term = values. Values bring stability and happiness.
> When we give in and let the state dictate our actions, we end up reinforcing whichever pattern happens to be firing at that time. 
> When values dictate our actions (even when the state *sucks*), we slowly reinforce brain wiring that actually *aligns* with the life we **want**.

It's easy to act on going to the gym when your brain hands you dopamine. It's harder when the brain dumps anxiety on you instead. But either way, we *can* choose. I know it's not easy, and I'm really not trying to make it sound easy; it's fucking hard, but what else can we do, man? The brain's gonna hand us a different feeling-stack based on whatever the hell it thinks has worked before, but *us*, the observer and experiencer, get to decide *regardless*. And whatever we choose, just remember that our brain will only make it more likely that we do that again next time. That doesn't mean our actions have to be perfect; we can't expect to *constantly* reinforce the **ideal**. However, it does mean doing everything we can to fight the *wrong* thing.
## Rumination and My Fear of Uncertainty

I've had pretty bad anxiety most of my life. Physically, my anxiety feels like extreme discomfort in my chest; it's a deep ache and pressure, and it gets harder to breathe or sit comfortably. With ADHD on top of that, the physical sensations are extremely overstimulating, and they've pushed me many times toward actions that have hurt me and the people around me:

- In an argument, anxiety triggers, and I want to yell, just to end the conversation or prove I'm right and stop the discomfort.
- At work, if my managers keep getting on to me, I'll quit to run away.
- If I expect a task to be tedious or annoying, I'll just avoid it as a freeze response.
- If I think I'm losing someone close, I'll over-apologize, over-praise, self-sacrifice, and fawn. Anything to make the anxiety back off and be reassured.

In all of these situations, and more I won't name, I'm not sitting there calmly choosing "Action X is optimal." I also wasn't consciously stepping in to *not* act on those urges. The wiring fired, the feelings flooded in, and I let them take the wheel.

A big amplifier for all of this has been rumination.

Rumination = overthinking loops. It's when you sit and stare at a limited chunk of input and try to squeeze meaning out of it for hours. It feels like you're making progress the more you think, but in reality, you're just sprinting down a mental hamster wheel while broadcasting 4K worst-case scenarios in your mind.

Example:
- Your friend doesn't respond to your text for like 6 hours.
- A ruminator brain starts:
	- "They're home... so they probably saw it."
	- "If they saw it, and they didn't respond... did I say something wrong?"
	- "Wait... do they not like me anymore?"
	- "Are they hanging out with someone else right now who they like more?"
	- "Am I being replaced?"
All of that is made-up. There could be a hundred reasons for the delay. You have no idea which reality you're in. And you cannot find out which one you're in by replaying the worst one in your head on a loop.

A typical thought pattern in ruminators is a deep fear of uncertainty. Uncertainty becomes automatically linked with danger:
- Anything that happens during the day becomes potential rumination fuel.
- One small adverse event doesn't feel like a small cut; it's hours of mental pain.
- The brain learns: "If I'm **certain**, at least I can predict and brace for the pain. If I'm *uncertain*, there's a chance I'll get blindsided again."

So the brain decides:
> The best way to protect us is to ruminate. If I can pre-feel the pain, it won't hurt as much.

Bruh.

On the surface, this doesn't help. But in the moment, it *feels* like trying to solve the problem. The loop is:

> Do something → Interaction happens → Ruminate → Anxiety waves → "See, doing things leads to anxiety and pain"

Over time, life itself began to feel dangerous. Any interaction could randomly spawn an anxiety episode with no warning. I became scared of *uncertainty* itself.

## Extinction Bursts: When Old Patterns Scream

Once we start changing long-standing patterns, they don't simply fade away. There's something behavior nerds call an extinction burst:

> [!NOTE] Extinction Burst
> When a habit or behavior pattern stops getting the reward it expects, it often spikes *harder* for a while, more urges and more intensity, until it finally dies down.

Think about drinking water:
- You need water to live.
- Two hours without water? You're chillin.
- A day without water? Thirsty and uncomfortable.
- Two days? You're fighting people for a cup of water.
- Three days? You're screaming and begging for a droplet of H₂O.
- Day four? You're dead.

As the system realizes it's actually in danger, it gets louder and more desperate.

Your brain functions similarly when it comes to habits.

Say your brain learned: "When we feel anxious, we smoke weed. Weed helps us feel better." It's gonna wire everything to make it as easy and automatic as possible to smoke in response to anxiety.

Now, let's say you decide to quit weed for your own reasons. The wiring doesn't exactly get the email. All it knows is:

> "We're anxious; where is my weed button??"

If you continue to refuse to hit that button, the circuit will start to fail. But, before it dies, it will *scream*. The cravings will get louder. The thoughts will get more naggy:

> "REMEMBER ME?
> DON'T YOU NEED ME?
> REMEMBER HOW THIS HELPED?"

It's trying to protect you using old data. It doesn't have access to your newer awareness or values.

So, when you're rewiring your brain, whether it's substances, rumination, avoidance, or fawning, whatever, there's a good chance it will get harder before it gets easier. That's the extinction burst.

This can feel... hopeless. My brain has tried to tell me:

> "It's already so hardddddddddddd. You're telling me it's gonna spike and get worse? How the hell can we beat that? It's not worth it."

The messed-up, but hopefully comforting, part is that when it gets louder, that's actually evidence that what you're doing is working. If the pattern wasn't under threat, it wouldn't be screaming so loudly to stay alive.

Let it scream. 

It will scream itself to death.

## Somatic Lag

The main reason I wanted to write this post is that I've been actively killing off some of my anxiety and rumination patterns, and I want a record, in some sense at least, of:

- What I went through
- What it took to change
- The fact that I ever felt this bad at all

If I continue to act in the right ways, my brain will reinforce my positive habits. I'm not claiming I'm "cured," this will probably be some kind of lifelong maintenance. However, I also know that my future self might forget just how intense things used to be.

Garrett, for the past few weeks, months, years, your anxiety has been deeply debilitating. We've given in to intense feelings of discomfort and rumination over and over, and our brain learned that was the only move on the board.

Recently, in particular, the anxiety went nuclear. Each day felt worse. Yesterday was less; today is less. So something is changing.

What's interesting is *how* it's changing.

Before, my anxiety was kind of this blend of:

- mental stuff: rumination, intrusive thoughts, self-doubt, perfectionism
- physical stuff: chest pain, tightness, body buzzing, restlessness

Lately, I've been breaking a lot of the mental loops. I'm interrupting my rumination, choosing actions based on my values, and staying grounded and regulated much more often. The cognitive part, the narratives and spirals, is wayyy quieter.

I'll be lying in bed, actually feeling happy and proud of my day, excited for tomorrow... and my chest is still like, "We should be panicking. We should be preparing for disaster. Why aren't we spiraling right now?"

You can think of it as a **somatic lag**.

The same circuits that feed rumination also talk to bodily systems, but they're not identical, and they don't update at the same speed. So there's a natural lag between "I understand I am safe" and "my chest believes me."

When that happens, admittedly, one of my old brain systems tries to sneak in:

> "See? It still hurts. We're exhausted. There's no point. Just give in."

That story is no longer true.

If anything, the fact that my body is still anxious while my mind isn't is the most substantial proof that my actions have been having an effect. I've changed how I respond mentally; the extinction burst is now mostly happening in my nervous system, rather than in my thoughts.

I can't expect my body to instantly catch up. But I also can't afford to start changing my behavior in response to those leftover sensations. That would just retrain the old patterns.

## Final Thoughts

If there's one thread running through all of this, it's that my anxiety isn't a moral failure or a curse dropped on me from the sky. It's a training problem.

- My amygdala learned to fire fast.
- My nervous system learned to expect pain from uncertainty.
- My habits and coping strategies got reinforced by years of repetition.

That means the way out is training, too.

Every time I notice a rumination loop and gently back out instead of feeding it, I'm giving my brain new training data. Every time I act from my values while my chest feels like a cement mixer, I'm proving to my nervous system that the sensations are survivable. I'm not trying to change my brain from the outside; I'm showing it, through my behavior, that the world is safer than I think it is.

Now, none of this counts unless my behavior is actually consistently different. This essay is a snapshot of my current model, not a scoreboard. Future me (and anyone else reading this), please don't treat these words as proof that "I got better." The real measure is:

- How I treat people when I'm tired, frustrated, anxious, or under any emotional bias.
- Whether I keep showing up for the hard tasks instead of avoiding them.
- What I do on a random Tuesday when nobody is watching, and my brain is screaming at me.

The extinction bursts and the somatic lag suck. They're loud, uncomfortable, and exhausting. But they're also evidence. They mean the old wiring is losing its grip. If it wasn't, it wouldn't need to yell this hard to try and stay in charge.

Future me, if you're reading this at a time when your body feels calmer, don't forget how much work went into that quiet. This wasn't magic or a single moment of enlightenment. It was hundreds of tiny, boring, brave choices:

- To not ruminate.
- To not run away.
- To not fawn.
- To not be aggressive.
- To act like our values matter more than our temporary state.

Anxiety might always be a part of the background. That's fine. The goal was never to have a perfectly silent amygdala. The goal is to build a life where our actions are led by what matters to us, not by whatever our fear circuits happen to be yelling at us about at the time.

# Analyzing my taste

Hey guys. This is my first glog post, and part of my brain keeps insisting that the first one has to be fully realized and special before I'm "allowed" to post it. The perfectionist part of my brain really wants me to overthink this into oblivion. 

That pattern isn't actually helpful though. The only way for the glog to become what I want it to be is by actually *using* it. I have to post, then I can upgrade it. I can't predict everything I'll eventually want to change, but I *can* find out by working on it in public, instead of keeping it in my head forever.

So for this post, I'm pretending this isn't "the first one." It's just *a* post. If I try to over-engineer my introduction, I know I'll never hit publish.
## Clothing as a Physical Manifestation of Taste

This morning I was mapping out a vision for a new wardrobe. 

For most of my life, I've put almost zero thought into my clothes or appearance. Old thought patterns (likely amplified by ADHD) made style feel like a waste of time and energy. My body just felt bored, hopeless, or lost anytime I tried to "do fashion."

But after a bunch of life events and growth, I'm in a different spot. I don't just *want* to put effort into my outfits now, I'm actively building a life where that effort is actually realistic day to day. The motivation is there *and* I'm setting up the conditions to act on it.

While I was researching clothes and catching up on basic style knowledge I'd been ignoring for years, I started thinking about what kind of designs I may want for my shirts.

I knew this much:
- I want shirts that each hold some unique value to me; graphics that feel personally enthralling.
- I want stuff that fits the alt vibe, *and* expresses my taste at the same time.

Sure, I could grab a bunch of plain black or muted shirts and look decent with some jeans. But then I'm not really expressing *me*, it's more like I'm merely expressing "alt fundamentals." Fundamentals are just foundations, you build *from* them, not *only* with them.

So, I needed a way to organize my taste. I needed to ask myself, "what are the actual 'buckets' of things I'm into that I'd want on my clothing?"

For Example:
I love **Attack on Titan**. If I found a dark, subtle, aesthetic AOT shirt that fits me well, that wouldn't just look good and match my vibe, it would be a *uniquely* me piece that coherently fits into my overall wardrobe.

The wardrobe becomes a physical manifestation of taste. My job is to make sure that my *actual* taste is what shows up in the fabric, not just whatever's lying around in my drawers, or the first thing I see at a store.
## Naming the Perfectionism Loop
BUT THEN! My brain threw a question at me: 

> "Okay, but how do I unify or understand what my taste is? How do I actually translate the vibes I feel into words and real clothing.

I can feel when something matches my taste. If I see it, I know. However, I can't just wander through life hoping items randomly spawn that suddenly "spark." I need a way to *manufacture* that feeling on purpose.

So I started by listing all the things I'm into that I could think of. No structure, just brain dumping. I didn't instantly start the dump, I sat and stirred for a while because it all felt like too much or I just wouldn't get it right.

This sequence kinda mimics exactly what happened when I got the urge to write the glog post in the first place.

- Desire for outcome
- Perfectionistic hesitation and overthinking
- Acceptance that it won't be perfect
- Acting towards my desired outcome regardless

I wasn't consciously narrating that at the time, but I *was* interrupting a harmful perfectionism loop in both cases, which is kinda cool.

My brain really wants me to sit and endlessly plan, research, analyze, and prepare so that by the time I do anything, it's perfect. That part of my brain is scared and trying to protect me. 

It believes with complete conviction:
- If we start and it isn't perfect I'm going to get hurt.
- I'm going to judge and doubt myself.
- Other people will also see it sucks or it's not perfect and they'll judge me too.

The protective system only has access to fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. None of those actions aligned with what **I**, the observer & experiencer, actually value. And in this situation, there isn't even a real threat to respond to.
- I'm not currently attacking myself
- I'm not being flamed or critisized
- My worth as a person isn't based on whether someone thinks this post is "mid."

The system *thinks* that's happening, so it feeds me garbage. Its tools are harmful, and it's threat analysis is dead wrong. The way through is this:

Look at the pattern. Name it. See it as a *system*, not **me**. Then choose how you want to respond. The choice is unavoidable. You either end up being the person who obeyed the fear, or the person who didn't. There's no avoiding it. So choose.
## Booting Up the Brain: Interest Mapping
Anyway, back to the clothes.

I started writing out all the different things I'm into, and then I just stared at the list and pondered. A lot of the early pondering is like "booting up my PC" so my ADHD brain can ground itself in the info I can't instantly see all at once.

I have to re-load:

- The symbolism in AOT
- The emotional arc of Hit Me Hard and Soft
- The plot and characters of Undertale
- The vibes and aesthetic of Cryalot's Icarus, etc.

Once I really sat inside those pieces of media, and the others I'm not all listing here, I started to feel them again, I started seeing connections I'd never noticed before.

Previously I just assumed:
> "I'm an enjoyer. Good media is good, and I like it. That's it."
> 
> Why does one thing wreck me emotionally while another barely touches me?
> 
 > "Who Knows :))))))"

That was the old, absent-minded version of me; same as how I used to move through fashion, same as how I used to move through many things.

But as I saw more connections, I got this huge wave of excitement and dopamine. It felt like seeing myself behind the curtain. On the surface, my taste is a bunch of separate titles and aesthetics. Underneath, there are recurring themes and emotional patterns my brain keeps falling in love with.

So here's what I noticed, and maybe I'm seeing constellations in random dots, but honestly? It's fun either way! : D
### Theme 1: Duality

Two opposite things held together at once:

- Light vs. Dark
- Hope vs. Despair
- Human vs. Monster
- Machine vs. Man
- Sanity vs. Madness

You can see this all over:

- Attack on Titan - Freedom vs. Slavery, Human vs. Titan, Monster vs. Savior.
- Mr. Robot - Rationality vs. Chaos, Sanity vs. Breakdown, Self vs. Alter-Self
- Undertale & Celeste - Determination *and* struggle; effort *and* failure; falling apart *and* getting back up; it's always both.

These stories are built out of duality. As a viewer, you don't just *watch* the conflict, you can *feel* the internal struggle. You have to wrestle with the duality in your own head, and those internal waves hook me.
### Theme 2: Tech / Glitches / System Energy
Aesthetically, there's a loud pattern too. A lot of what I love hits this Tech / Gitchy / System Energy vein.

Think:

- Cyberpunk Edges
- Glitch Art
- HUD Overlays
- Console/Terminal Vibes
- Digital Noise, Neon, Corrupted Screens

It's not like everything I like is textbook "cyberpunk," but colors, layouts, sounds, and textures from that vibe resonate with me over and over. Techy menus, weird UIs, distorted systems, that whole family of visuals and sounds makes my brain light up good.
### Theme 3: Psych Themes & Emotional Intensity
I'm also very drawn toward psychology and raw emotional intensity.

I like media that:

- Dives into mental health and messy inner worlds
- Shows chaotic ups and downs instead of clean linear arcs
- Lets characters be deeply flawed and still human

I care a lot about the human experience. I've had my share of deep pits, but I'm on the other side of a lot of them now. Those moments don't *define* me. I am not the pain; I am not the impact; I am the one who *experienced* it.

Same with urges and actions:

- I feel the urge
- I notice the urge
- I choose what to *do* with the feeling

Even if I choose wrong, I'm still the observer and experiencer, not the choice, and not the feeling.

That ability to bring awareness to the state of our minds and then decide what to do is insanely rare and special; All humans have this. Meta-cognition is what makes our species what it is. Animals act as the animal. Their brian fires, and they respond. 

But Humans Get:

- Brain systems firing
- Feelings arising
- Thoughts commenting on those feelings.
- The ability to choose a response.

That's nuts. I feel so lucky to have this experience at all, even when it's painful or "less than optimal." I don't want to spend my entire life fighting and screaming whenever I feel something hard. I'd rather look for the value in that experience, the growth it can fuel, and the beauty of the mess.

When music, games, stories, or shows let me experience a version of someone else's internal chaos in a vivid way, that's incredibly valuable to me. That's what being human is all about.
### Theme 4: Symbolic & Classical Obsessions
Last thread for today: my fascination with symbolic and classical stuff.

Things like:

- Roman History
- Chemistry
- Ancient Philosophy
- Foundational Truths (Across Disciplines)

Even if I can't instantly list every example or cross connect this theme to the other pieces of media I've mentioned so far, this "classical + fundamental" category just feels right, in my bones.

When something is:

- Historical
- Foundational
- Structurally important

... it just feels like it matters more. I'm not making a merit based decision that it's more valuable, but I can't deny that my brain and body feel it more.

Describing the universe and reality in terms of atoms and molecules? That hits in a way nothing did before. Reading about early philosophers trying to may the mind with no modern tools and nothing but thought? That hits too.

It's like watching the source code of human understanding slowly get written.
## Wrapping it Up
Okay I think that's probably enough for this post.

There's no grand thesis here or some huge announcement really, just some observations about my own mind that got me excited and motivated to write. Mapping my interests out like this makes it easier for me to design things (My bedroom, My wardrobe, The Glog) that actually feel like *me* instead of just borrowing aesthetics from the internet or strictly following a set of arbitrary rules, and that makes me real happy.

If any part of this thought process resonated with you, that's sick, if not, that's cool too. This is mostly me leaving breadcrumbs so Future Me can look back and see how my brain was wired at this time, and how it might change as time passes. 

Hope you got some enjoyment out of it < 3
